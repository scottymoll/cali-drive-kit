# Performance Metrics and Accessibility Checks

## Performance Metrics

To ensure optimal performance of the site, we monitor the following key metrics:

1. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Measures the time taken for the first piece of content to be rendered on the screen.
2. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: The time it takes for the page to become fully interactive.
3. **Speed Index**: A score that indicates how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated.
4. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures the loading performance of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport.
5. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: A metric that measures visual stability, indicating how much the layout shifts during the loading phase.

## Accessibility Checks

Accessibility is crucial for ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the site. We perform the following checks:

1. **Color Contrast**: Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Verifying that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Testing the site with screen readers to ensure proper reading order and context.
4. **Alt Text for Images**: Ensuring all images have descriptive alt text for better accessibility.
5. **Semantic HTML**: Using appropriate HTML elements to convey meaning and structure.
